ALSACE is a Python software for multivariate approximation based on polynomial 
chaos expansions (PCs). The PC coefficients are computed using least squares 
(LS) regression. The PC polynomial basis as well as the experimental design used
in the LS problem are expanded adaptively by exploiting parameter anisotropies 
and LS stability estimates. The software has been developed as part of our work 
at the Institute for Accelerator Science and Electromagnetic Fields (TEMF) of TU 
Darmstadt.

The present software and the related examples rely partially on the OpenTURNS 
C++/Python library.
